## About Books And courses

This is a collection of books and courses I can recommend personally.
They are great for every data engineering learner.

I either have used or own these books during my professional work.

I also looked into every online course personally.

If you want to buy a book or course and support my work, please use one of my links below. They are all affiliate marketing links that help me fund this passion.

Of course all this comes at no additional expense to you, but it helps me a lot.

You can find even more interesting books and my whole podcast equipment on my Amazon store:

PS: Don't just get a book and expect to learn everything
  - Course certificates alone help you nothing
  - Have a purpose in mind, like a small project
  - Great for use at work

### Community Recommendations

#### Designing Data-Intensive Applications

"In my opinion, the knowledge contained in this book differentiates a data engineer from a software engineer or a developer. The book strikes a good balance between breadth and depth of discussion on data engineering topics, as well as the tradeoffs we must make due to working with massive amounts of data." -- David Lee on LinkedIn
