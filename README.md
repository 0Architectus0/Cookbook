# The Data Engineering Cookbook
I get asked super often how to become a data engineer.
That's why I decided to start this cookbook with all the topics you need to look into. 
  
It's not only useful for beginners, professionals will definitely like the case study section.

Here's the **download** shortcut: \

## How to use the cookbook
I split this cookbook into multiple parts
+ In part one you will learn the basics
+ Part two will contain a real world data engineering example 
+ The third part contains over 30 case studies with links to interesting presentations
