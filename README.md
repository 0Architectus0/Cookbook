# The Data Engineering Cookbook
I get asked super often how to become a Data Engineer.
That's why I decided to start this cookbook with all the topics you need to look into.

It's not only useful for beginners, professionals will definitely like the case study section.

## How to contribute
If you have some cool links or topics for the cookbook, please become a contributor.
Simply open an issue and add your links. Or pull the repo, add them and create a pull request.

Please pull only the "working-branch" branch. \
This way we keep the master branch clean and I don't have to mess around resolving conflicts. You just need to change the .tex file. I'll recompile it later when I merge the branch with the master

For comments please also use the "Issues" function.
